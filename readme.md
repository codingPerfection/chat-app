#About
On back files are served using gzip compression (where it makes sense) and front is packed using webpack.
Thanks for giving me opportunity to do this and I am looking forward to your review.

##Back
Back uses express for serving static files and socket.io for communication

##Front
Front uses react with mobx, communication is done using socket from Store.js and is packed with webpack
